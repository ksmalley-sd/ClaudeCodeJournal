      "whatILearned": "Trying to include more than “MVP” requirements, e.g. “use AI and NLP to support intent from users” as a choice rather than “Keep it simple and easy to build” led to… Issues with sharing my keys again! Claude is good about calling it out, I pasted an error that exposed my key. Maybe we all need some safety training? I got lost on json updates, file updates, key updates in json files, and errors started coming in. I asked claude, it helped, but it still assumes a lot. Be careful not get to get too far ahead of yourself. Testing with others is helpful! Sessions end and claude code can lose context, but seems to be aware of that. No problems to be seen at the moment, but something I’m guessing I should keep an eye on.",
      "biggestChallenge": "I’ve enjoyed being at my computer and manually \"allowing\" each Claude action, get a sense of what’s going on. But now I want to “allow always” but I’m worried a bit about safety of doing that. Is there a way to know?",

      "howItWent": "This was the easiest so far (partially because of what I've learned in previous days). Other than the prompt, no back and forth after the initial feedback I asked Claude to ask me too settle on scope. Claude finished, gave me the command prompts to run and admin password. Having to write up this info has been the most time consuming part.",

While browsing, I found some fun examples that gave me the idea I went with, Magic cards and a Magic the gathering playmat immersive look and feel. Claude noticed a sentence I didn't finish in my second prompt, and asked me about it to make sure it had it clear before it continued on. It prompted me with a few options, the first option was correct.",
      "whatILearned": "Rules based engine would be easier (and cheaper) than 1 powered by AI. I started with a local only version but told Claude I might want to push it live in the future. This is the first time I tried spending a bit more effort on \"improving the look and feel\" of a website or tool. I tried uploading images I took from examples I found on the web.",
      "biggestChallenge": "After seeing the first version come so close to \"immersive\", going back and forth trying to get it to look good was harder than I thought. Not sure if it's a capability issue for claude, if my prompts are not great, need to play with with \"improving look and feel\"",

Set up bash (hard on windows for some reason?) Some issues with my PATH? All new things, and having a programmer ride shotgun was great, but",
      "whatILearned": "Knowing how to get my API key from a previous project was critical! Using Claude CLI means a bit less of an easy back and forth, so there wasn't an \n\nI typically write \"please\" and \"thank you\" in most of my prompts and responses. The programmer who helped me get set up explained that it's better to be direct, clear and remove extra things. They can just get in the way of the job getting done.",
