      "howItWent": "Surprisingly smooth for day one. Claude understood exactly what I wanted from a single prompt. The only friction was getting the CSS styling baked into the output — I had to ask for a second pass to make it look less like 1995.",
      "whatILearned": "Claude is excellent at well-defined, bounded tasks like this. The clearer the output format, the better the first result. Starting simple builds confidence.",
      "biggestChallenge": "Getting the output HTML to be truly self-contained (no external dependencies) without it looking terrible.",

      "howItWent": "Pretty straightforward, but a lot of small steps and errors along the way this time. Lots and lots of railway deploy issues, but it worked through it, i just needed to paste logs and keep it going\nBut it worked! Now the problem is with the data in the google sheet. Not really a claude code problem. This was slower due to my need to onboard to some simple (i Imagine) eng services.",
      "whatILearned": "Railway! - Lots of back and forth this time, not sure why. Build keeps failing, says there are ram issues. \nDon’t even put things related to private keys in Claude messages! It stopped me, and directed me to go delete and change the key. I did. Not sure what Grok would have done there… For sure save keys, important claude code commands you’ll re-run (starting the service) in a word or notepad doc. You’ll need stuff over and over.",
      "biggestChallenge": "Not knowing some of the basics of command prompting, railway, API key generation. Small errors cost time (only 3-5 mins per, but they add up)",

      "howItWent": "Started during lunch break, continued after hours during commander game, this time asking my team members to help test, which was great. Testing highlighted some small changes, and helped me think about actually making it for viable for a team to use.",
      "whatILearned": "Trying to include more than “MVP” requirements, e.g. “use AI and NLP to support intent from users” as a choice rather than “Keep it simple and easy to build” led to… Issues with sharing my keys again! Claude is good about calling it out, I pasted an error that exposed my key. Maybe we all need some safety training? I got lost on json updates, file updates, key updates in json files, and errors started coming in. I asked claude, it helped, but it still assumes a lot. Be careful not get to get too far ahead of yourself. Testing with others is helpful! Sessions end and claude code can lose context, but seems to be aware of that. No problems to be seen at the moment, but something I’m guessing I should keep an eye on.",
      "biggestChallenge": "I’ve enjoyed being at my computer and manually \"allowing\" each Claude action, get a sense of what’s going on. But now I want to “allow always” but I’m worried a bit about safety of doing that. Is there a way to know?",

      "howItWent": "This was the easiest so far (partially because of what I've learned in previous days). Other than the prompt, no back and forth after the initial feedback I asked Claude to ask me too settle on scope. Claude finished, gave me the command prompts to run and admin password. Having to write up this info has been the most time consuming part.",
      "whatILearned": "Getting comfortable with simple command line prompts is empowering. Telling Claude to suggest improvements or ask for clarity if needed seems to be really productive.",
      "biggestChallenge": "Entering in the information for all of the projects to date. (Claude anticipated this, and asked me hjow many I had, to determine if there was a need for a data migration step.) Finding examples of what I wanted the to look like also took a few minutes.",
