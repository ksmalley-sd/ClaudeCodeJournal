Claude is good about calling it out, I pasted an error that exposed my key. Maybe we all need some safety training? I got lost on json updates, file updates, key updates in json files, and errors started coming in. I asked claude, it helped, but it still assumes a lot. Be careful not get to get too far ahead of yourself. Testing with others is helpful! Sessions end and claude code can lose context, but seems to be aware of that. No problems to be seen at the moment, but something I’m guessing I should keep an eye on.",

Using Claude CLI means a bit less of an easy back and forth, so there wasn't an \n\nI typically write \"please\" and \"thank you\" in most of my prompts and responses.

This time I didn't prompt it to walk me through the things I need to do in a step by step way, and it just said \"put in your API keys\", which is a thing I now know how to do without step by step instructions! First test wasn't working, and it took me a minute to figure out that I should go back to the windows command prompt to look for errors. I found them, pasted them back in to claude and got it fixed.",

It seemed like the least amount of questions I needed to answer and least amount of errors I have seen with a project yet, until... it had an issue outputting the survey options, and it recognized that the error logging was good enough, and that the token max was likely too low to output multiple survey options.",
      "whatILearned": "The set up of Slack Bots and getting API keys is getting easier with each project, but the steps are still specific and numerous enough that I need to ask for support in how to do it each time. I'm thinking about a way to simplify or automate this part. Also, I explicitly asked Claude to make it so expert market researchers would find the output acceptable. I think adding that to the prompt increased the steps and sophistication of the questions in the survey creation wizard steps. Also, I had previously been switching from Claude CLI in a bash tab to the command prompt tab when i was starting and restarting the bots. This time, I tried to stay in the Claude CLI tool the whole time, and it caused issues (at one point there was apparently 6 bots running at the same time causing issues with session timeouts and connection issues)",
